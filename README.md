# Biquadris
## Description
Biquadris is a turn-based, competitive version of the classic game Tetris, enriched with new mechanics that enhance the original gameplayâ€”such as special actions, multiple difficulty levels, and both text-based and graphical interfaces. This project aims to design and implement a robust, object-oriented program that transforms these ideas into an engaging experience for the user.

This game was written solely in C++.

NOTE: The source code is available to view upon request, but is not open to the public due to Policy 71 of the University of Waterloo.
